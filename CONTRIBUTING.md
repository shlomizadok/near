# Contributing to NEAR Framework

We love your input! We want to make contributing to NEAR Framework as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/near/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/near/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Coding Style

- We use TypeScript for type safety
- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- We use Prettier for code formatting
- We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification

## Testing

- Write tests for all new features and fixes
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Run the test suite before submitting a PR

## Documentation

- Update documentation for any changed functionality
- Add JSDoc comments for all new functions and classes
- Keep README.md up to date

## Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - 🎨 `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  - 🐎 `:racehorse:` when improving performance
  - 🚱 `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
  - 📝 `:memo:` when writing docs
  - 🐛 `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  - 🔥 `:fire:` when removing code or files
  - 💚 `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
  - ✅ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
  - 🔒 `:lock:` when dealing with security
  - ⬆️ `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
  - ⬇️ `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with a note describing your changes.
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer.

## Code Review Process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
